"""
This code is based on a demo routine in the paramiko project. I am not
pretending to have written it, but I have adapted it for University of
Richmond's purposes. I have also clarified the names of the objects,
and added comments. There is also a wrapper, and I have converted it to
Python3. 

Most of my comments are prefaced with -g->. All functions except for
drill_baby_drill() start with a leading underscore and are not imported
except if they are explicitly listed.

Come to think of it .... I guess it is a rewrite.
